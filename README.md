# Build Utils

[![Build Utils CI](https://github.com/rchargel/build-utils/workflows/Build%20Utils%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/rchargel/build-utils/actions)

This project contains project build utilities which have employed on my corporate work, 
and which I thought could be re-packaged and re-designed for open source work as well.

Here is the current list of utilities packaged herein:

* **[JMH Benchmarking Maven Plugin](./jmh-benchmarking-maven-plugin)** - A wrapper around the [Java Microbenchmarking Harness](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-performance/jmh.html)

## Change Log

**0.9** - 3/24/2021

* Initial Release
