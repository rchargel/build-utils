This project contains project build utilities which have employed on my corporate work, 
and which I thought could be re-packaged and re-designed for open source work as well.

Here is the current list of utilities packaged herein:

* **[JMH Benchmarking Maven Plugin](./jmh-benchmarking-maven-plugin)** - A wrapper around the [Java Microbenchmarking Harness](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-performance/jmh.html)

## Change Log

**0.9** - 3/24/2021

* Initial Release
